2**Build Process**:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Vite optimization and bundling
   - Asset optimization

3**Deployment**:
   - Automatic staging deployment on PR approval
   - Production deployment on main branch merges
   - Rollback capabilities for failed deployments

### Integration Points

- **GitHub Actions** for PR validation and automated testing
- **Docker** images built and pushed to container registry
